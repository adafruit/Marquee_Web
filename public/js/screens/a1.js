/**
 * A1 — your displays.
 *
 * Home, and the only screen that is about more than one device. Everything else in the
 * app is written against whichever record is active; this is where that changes.
 *
 * Two states in one screen. With devices it is a grid of tiles plus a dashed add slot;
 * with none it is the add slot alone. There is no separate empty-state screen because
 * there is nothing separate to say — the grid already contains the one action, and an
 * onboarding panel that appears and then never appears again is a screen most users
 * see exactly once.
 *
 * Tiles show what is on the panel rather than a device name and a status, which is what
 * makes the list read like a wall of little screens. The picture comes from the cache
 * a8.js writes on every confirmed draw — and, for every display this browser has never
 * watched draw, from that display's own bitmap feed, read here (see sweepThumbs). The
 * cache alone left most of the wall saying "Nothing drawn yet" about boards with a
 * perfectly good picture published to them.
 *
 * The pill beside it comes from that display's own STATUS feed, read the same way and
 * for the same reason — see the status section below, which is the longer version of
 * why a stored snapshot could not answer it.
 *
 * It is also where the Adafruit IO account is settled. The add tile is gated on one:
 * setup writes feeds from its first step, so a display added without a checked
 * username and key is a display whose setup cannot finish. See a1c.js.

// ---------- what each display is actually doing ------------------------------
//
// From the board's own status feed, and from nothing else.
//
// These tiles used to read `rec.flow` — a snapshot of live flow state, mirrored into
// the record by main.js's subscribe. Three things were wrong with that, and they
// compounded into a wall of boards all claiming to be on air while they slept:
//
//   - That mirror only ever writes the ACTIVE record, and only one status feed is ever
//     polled (device.js resolves statusFeedKey() through the live #ioGroup field). So
//     every other tile was frozen at whatever its board's state was the last time it
//     was open — and the usual freeze is the worst one. You push, the board goes
//     'online-awake' with a lastWriteAt, you switch away, and the tile says On air for
//     good while the board is off sleeping.
//   - "Live" was `!asleep && !!lastWriteAt`. lastWriteAt is the EDITOR's own write, so
//     it is evidence about the editor; and excluding only 'asleep' meant a board
//     device.js had already judged 'offline' came out green as well.
//   - state.js#normalize() nulls lastWokeAt/lastSleptAt on the way in, precisely
//     because they are stale claims about a board that has since moved on. A tile
//     reading them straight out of the record was trusting exactly what state.js
//     refuses to.
//
// So each display's state is read from its OWN {group}.status feed — the same feed
// device.js watches, through the same reading (cycle.js#readReport), judged silent by
// the same rule (cycle.js#reportIsOverdue). A record carries its own group key, so this
// needs no activation, exactly like the thumbnail sweep below.
//
// NO MODELLING. A board that has never reported is shown as not having reported. The
// modelled cycle that used to answer this question was deleted for not surviving
// contact with hardware (see cycle.js), and a wall of twelve tiles is the last place to
// reintroduce it twelve times over.
//
// In memory for the session only — deliberately unlike the thumbnail cache next door. A
// picture stays true until something redraws it; "asleep, wakes at 9:47" does not, and a
// cached one restored tomorrow morning would be a lie with a timestamp on it.
