/**
 * A4 — pick the device.
 *
 * Product cards, not a dropdown of driver chips. Choosing a card applies the whole
 * preset — resolution, rotation, colour mode, driver, panel id and every SPI pin — so
 * nothing downstream has to ask about hardware again.
 *
 * Three cards, from FEATURED_KEYS. The catalog in presets.js is longer and every entry
 * in it still works; these are the ones this flow can take someone through end to end.
 * A device migrated from an older build pointed at one of the others keeps running,
 * because nothing reads the featured list at runtime.
 *
 * The card copy comes from cardLabel/cardMeta where a preset defines them, because the
 * name on the box and the panel this descriptor drives are not always the same string —
 * the tri-color card names its host board's PSRAM, which no panel descriptor knows
 * about.
 *
 * The photo slots are grey placeholders by design: real Adafruit product shots go there,
 * and the design system duotones them through the .duotone wrapper.
